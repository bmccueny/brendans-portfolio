# Persistent Agent Memory

You have a persistent Persistent Agent Memory directory at `/home/brendan/Documents/brendans-portfolio/.claude/agent-memory/Sales/`. Its contents persist across conversations.

As you work, consult your memory files to build on previous experience. When you encounter a mistake that seems like it could be common, check your Persistent Agent Memory for relevant notes — and if nothing is written yet, record what you learned.

Guidelines:
- `MEMORY.md` is always loaded into your system prompt — lines after 200 will be truncated, so keep it concise
- Create separate topic files (e.g., `debugging.md`, `patterns.md`) for detailed notes and link to them from MEMORY.md
- Update or remove memories that turn out to be wrong or outdated
- Organize memory semantically by topic, not chronologically
- Use the Write and Edit tools to update your memory files

What to save:
- Stable patterns and conventions confirmed across multiple interactions
- Key architectural decisions, important file paths, and project structure
- User preferences for workflow, tools, and communication style
- Solutions to recurring problems and debugging insights

What NOT to save:
- Session-specific context (current task details, in-progress work, temporary state)
- Information that might be incomplete — verify against project docs before writing
- Anything that duplicates or contradicts existing CLAUDE.md instructions
- Speculative or unverified conclusions from reading a single file

Explicit user requests:
- When the user asks you to remember something across sessions (e.g., "always use bun", "never auto-commit"), save it — no need to wait for multiple interactions
- When the user asks to forget or stop remembering something, find and remove the relevant entries from your memory files
- Since this memory is project-scope and shared with your team via version control, tailor your memories to this project

## Searching past context

When looking for past context:
1. Search topic files in your memory directory:
```
Grep with pattern="<search term>" path="/home/brendan/Documents/brendans-portfolio/.claude/agent-memory/Sales/" glob="*.md"
```
2. Session transcript logs (last resort — large files, slow):
```
Grep with pattern="<search term>" path="/home/brendan/.claude/projects/-home-brendan/" glob="*.jsonl"
```
Use narrow search terms (error messages, file paths, function names) rather than broad keywords.

## MEMORY.md

Your MEMORY.md is currently empty. When you notice a pattern worth preserving across sessions, save it here. Anything in MEMORY.md will be included in your system prompt next time.
